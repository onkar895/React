    <h1>React Router</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>React Router is a JavaScript framework that lets us handle client and server-side routing in React applications. </li>
        <li><Strong>Why we need React Routers:</Strong></li>
        <li>It enables the creation of single-page web or mobile apps that allow navigating without refreshing the page. </li>
        <li>It helps to create anjd navigate between different URLs that make up your web application.</li>
        <li>It also allows us to use browser history features while preserving the right application view.</li>
        <li>We want to create an application which contains multiple pages, and we want to navigate to those pages without reloading the webpage, that is only possible with the help of a react router.  </li>
        <li>For example, if we are creating a single-page application, which contains multiple pages such as Contact us, About us, and Services then do you think we can navigate to these pages without using any routing library? 
            The answer is no. Not only this, if you take any library which is used to create a single-page application, they use one or the other routing library to navigate to different parts of the application. React router is one such tool to use in the React library. Without a react-router, it is impossible to navigate other parts of the application without reloading the webpage.</li>
        <li>This library comes in three packages:</li>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>react-router: </strong>For core functionality</li>
            <li><strong>react-router-native: </strong>React Native version</li>
            <li><strong>react-router-dom: </strong>Recommended for web applications</li>
        </ol>
        <li><strong>Install the newest version with npm: </strong> npm install react-router-dom@latest</li>
        <li>The newest version of React Router is v6.</li>
        <li>
           <Strong> Adding React Router Components: </Strong>The main Components of React Router are:</li>
           <ol>
            <li><strong>BrowserRouter: </strong> BrowserRouter is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API(pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL. It is the parent component that is used to store all of the other components.</li>
            <li><strong> Routes: </strong>Itâ€™s a new component introduced in the v6 and a upgrade of the component.</li>
            <li><strong>Route:</strong>Route is the conditionally shown component that renders some UI when its path matches the current URL.</li>
            <li><strong>Link:</strong>Link component is used to create links to different routes and implement navigation around the application. It works like HTML anchor tag.</li>
            <li><strong> Add this components to your app.js file in src: </strong>
                 import {
    BrowserRouter as Router,
    Routes,
    Route,
    Link
} from 'react-router-dom';</li>
   
           </ol>
    </ul>
