// 1. BrowserRouter: BrowserRouter is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API(pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL. 
//                             It is the parent component that is used to store all of the other components.
// 2. Routes: Itâ€™s a new component introduced in the v6 and a upgrade of the component
// 3. Route: Route is the conditionally shown component that renders some UI when its path matches the current URL.
// 4. Link: Link component is used to create links to different routes and implement navigation around the application. It works like HTML anchor tag.
