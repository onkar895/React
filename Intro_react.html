    <span>React Introduction: </span>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>React </strong> is a free and open-source JavaScript library for building interactive websites and user interfaces or front-end webpage components such as forms along with fields like text areas and buttons.</li>
        <li>Since its release in 2013, React has been maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) along with a community of developers and companies.</li>
        <li>It is component-based. An example of a component could be a form or even just a form field or button on a website. In React, applications are completely built with components.</li>
        <li>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. <br> React is used to build single-page applications. <br> React allows us to create reusable UI components.</li>
        <li>ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library created by Facebook's Jordan Walke to make user interfaces for both web and mobile systems. <br> React was first used in 2011 on Facebook's newsfeed. In 2012, it was used on Instagram, and in 2013 it
            was made available to the public. <br> React is best for applications that change their data quickly and dynamically. <br> It can show the parts of the UI that are changing without re-rendering the whole page. This makes the user experience
            much faster.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul><strong>How does react work:</strong> 
        <li>While building client-side apps, a team of Facebook developers realized that the DOM is slow (The Document Object Model
        (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents.)</li>
        <li>It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.</li>
        <li>So, to make it faster, React implements a virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in JavaScript.</li>
        <li>So when it needs to read or write to the DOM, it will use the virtual representation of it. Then the virtual DOM will
        try to find the most efficient way to update the browserâ€™s DOM.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>NPX: (Node Package Execute)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It allows the developers to to execute different javascript packages available on the npm.</li>
    </ul>
